High-resolution livestock seasonal distribution data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2020

Welcome to the GitHub page for the High-resolution livestock seasonal distribution data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2020, where we provide a division of cold-season and warm-season pastures on the QTP, and livestock, cattle, and sheep number distribution data on each of the seasonal pastures, in dasymetric representation at a spatial resolution of 500 m.

The scripts used in the paper are stored in the Seasonal_pasture and Livestock_density directory.

The scripts in the Seasonal_pasture folder introduce how to predict the warm/cold-season pasture, while the scripts in the Livestock_density folder detail how to predict livestock density distribution. The code in this study is fully operational under Python 3.8.8.
